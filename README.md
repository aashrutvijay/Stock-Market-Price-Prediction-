# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction

We made this project for a hackathon conducted by COE, Pune.

In this project, we looked at the data of the stocks of some of the major tech. companies. 

We obtained the stock information and visualized it in different aspects for eg. the moving average for different time frames. We also plotted different correlation plots between all the stocks using their daily returns to find some correlation.

We predicted the future stock prices using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) mode.
